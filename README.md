# Sample-Tipping-App
Demo of my current Android programming abilities. Pretty basic, not too fancy.
## What it looks like:

## Skill set highlights
While this is a pretty basic app, some of the skills involved were:

-1 Implementing a clickable, scrollable, ListView item set, displaying both a piece of text and image on each item (use of an ArrayAdapter).

-2 Using gradation to add subtle depth and interest to ListView items and number inputs on activity pages

-3 Creating bevelled button and ListView items

-4 Tipping calculation shows all tipping options at once by simultaneously modifying 3 (or 4) TextViews

## Recent changes/upgrades:

-1 Error handling for number inputs; it shows a toast error message instead of crashing  ^_^

-2 Default "settings" menu selection upon click at lower left hand side of screen throws up a toast message detailing version and creator instead of nothing.

-3 First Column, to the left of the 'Tip Column' in each activity, now has a descriptor of each level of tipping, i.e. 'Minimum', 'Very Good', 'Excellent'

## Future possible upgrades:

-1 Add a language option (probably Traditional Chinese) to settings menu.

-2 Add more tipping scenarios, for instance 'bathroom attendent'

-3 Calculate tip and new total for each person when splitting a check (so the waiter doesn't have to)

-4 Add a 'Tips for Tipping' page under the settings menu
